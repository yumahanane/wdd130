            <p>Hello! My name is Yuma Natalia Hanane. I am from Beira, in Mozambique. I am pursuing a B.S. in Software Development at BYU-Idaho, through the BYU Pathway Worldwide Program. Previously, I attended Marist College, where I pursued a B.A. in Mathematics. I am a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I was baptized 18 years ago. Currently, I do not have any callings at church. My last callings were as First Counselor in the Stake Young Women Presidency, my ward's Senior Sunday School Class Teacher, and my ward's Seminary Teacher.</p>

            <p>Mozambique is located in the east coast of Southern Africa. It borders with Tanzania and Malawi in the north, Zambia and Zimbabwe in the west, and Swaziland and South Africa in the south. It is rich in natural resources such as natural gas, coal, minerals, and hydropower. Tourists can enjoy paradisiacal beaches, diverse gastronomy, and safaris.</p>
